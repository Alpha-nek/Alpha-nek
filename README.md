- Hi, I’m Yazan Al-Fanek. I have been an internal medicine physician for many years. I'm trying to find my purpose in a post-burnout world. Inspired by Wonka -the movie- (2023), I've decided to embark on a new journey in AI, and hope to share with you my projects in hopes to inspire you and to make this world a better place.
- I’m interested in Deep Learning applications in Medicine and Biology
